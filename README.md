# About this project

- Helldivers is a 4 persons, Cooperative, top-down shooter game developed by [Arrowhead Game Studios](http://arrowheadgamestudios.com/games/helldivers/)
- When you dive into a mission you need to chooses your loadouts such as Shotgun, Flamethrower and stuffs
- There is a random loadout generator such as [Vanemiera - Helldivers loadout randomizer](http://vanemiera.net/liber-coffee/) but it was too random. For an example you get a rifle but did get an ammunition resupply
- Thus, I create this helldivers not-so-random loadout generator
